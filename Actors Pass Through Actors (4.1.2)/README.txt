Description-
This plugin allows for all actors to pass through other actors, including the player, even when collisions are enabled in a move event.
Moving actors will no longer stop moving when colliding with another actor.
This is useful for when you want enemy actors to collide with the player.

Installation instructions-
Create a folder called 'plugins' inside the root folder of your GB Studio project.
Add the 'Actors Pass Through Actors' folder that contains this readme file to the 'plugins' folder.
Reopen your project in GB Studio.
The 'Engine Field Update' event can now be used to toggle actors passing through one another on and off.
By default, the toggle is off, so add an event to turn it on.
