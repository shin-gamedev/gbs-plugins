Made for GB Studio 4.1.2
Released 1/17/2025

Description-
This plugin allows 0-3 actors to follow the player in a Top Down scene. The plugin adds an engine field called 'Number of Followers' that can be changed from the settings or at runtime from the 'Engine Field Update' event. The plugin selects that number of actors in the scene as followers, starting with the first actor. For example, when 'Number of Followers' is equal to 3, Actor 1, Actor 2 and Actor 3 will be selected as followers in that order. You can reorder actors in your scene by dragging them out and back in to add them to the end of the order list.

Installation instructions-
Create a folder called 'plugins' inside the root folder of your GB Studio project.
Add the 'Top Down Followers' folder that contains this readme file to the 'plugins' folder.
Reopen your project in GB Studio and compile your game.
